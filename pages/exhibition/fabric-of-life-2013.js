          ‘Fabric of Life’ brought together artists and communities in a
          creative response to the building of a new school in the village of
          Jhong, Nepal. This exciting site-specific event in the historic Great
          Hall was&nbsp;raising awareness and support for this unusual voluntary
          project led by architect and artist, Beatrix Kovacs, as well as
          nurture links between cultures and communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visual artists, writers, dancers and musicians collaborated to create
          a unique event inspired by the landscape of Nepal, the materials and
          construction techniques to be used in the design of the school, and
          aspects of Nepalese, British and African cultures. The emphasis
          was&nbsp;on natural materials and elements – cloth, clay, timber,
          solar energy – and simple traditional forms.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was&nbsp;a free event, which aimed to build on the engagement
          between local people and art in Winchester.&nbsp;Everyone
          was&nbsp;welcome to join&nbsp;and share in this cultural exchange.

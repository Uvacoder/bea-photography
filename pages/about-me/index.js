			<p>
				I am profoundly influenced by the sense of touch, inspired by the less
				noticed texture of the everyday world. The rusty metal roof, the soft
				windswept grass, the uneven cobbled streetâ€¦..when I perceive these
				surfaces, my finger-tips almost immediately begin to tingle.
			</p>

			<p>
				I like simple coherent statements, clarity and logic. I am fascinated by
				the high contrast that light &amp; shadow generates; it powerfully but
				quietly focuses the mind. It gives a very precise three dimensional
				experience and a deeper understanding of the textures.
			</p>

			<p>
				I enjoy the organic process of making. It is like a journey of
				discovery, an intuitive response to internal and external conditions.
				There is no predetermined final destination, just a concept. It is a
				dialogue with the object or material when there is space and time to
				allow myself to trust my instinct and subconscious.
			</p>

			<p>I believe in openness, curiosity and compassion. Be(e) happy!</p>

				I was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1974. I graduated from the Technical
				University of Budapest with a master degree (MSc) in Architecture and
				Building Engineering in 1997. I am a qualified architect and have been
				living and working in England since 2000, becoming British citizen in
				2010.
